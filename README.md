***Tamper Detection in Academic Credentials***

**Objective**
To build a rule-based prototype that detects tampering in academic credentials, specifically:

Degree Certificates

Academic Transcripts

Professional Certifications

The system flags inconsistencies in metadata, template usage, and document editors across structured Excel files and embedded PDF metadata.
